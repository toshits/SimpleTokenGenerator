# Simple Token Generator

This project is an open-source Visual Basic Script (VBS) that generates random tokens. When executed, the script generates a token and automatically copies it to your clipboard, making it easy to paste wherever you need it.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Just double-click the script file to generate a token.
- **Clipboard Integration**: The generated token is automatically copied to your clipboard.
- **Portable**: No installation required, simply run the script.

## Usage

1. **Download**: Clone the repository or download the `TokenGenerator.vbs` file.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toshits/SimpleTokenGenerator.git
   ```

2. **Run the Script**: Double-click on the `TokenGenerator.vbs` file. A new token will be generated and copied to your clipboard.

3. **Paste the Token**: You can now paste the token anywhere you need it using `Ctrl + V`.

## Customization

If you want to customize the token generation logic (e.g., token length, character set), you can open the `TokenGenerator.vbs` file in a text editor and modify the relevant sections of the script.
